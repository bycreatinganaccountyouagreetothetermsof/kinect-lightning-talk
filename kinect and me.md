### why would ms be nice and use a standard bus for a fancy console accessory??

#### now what
###### we are lost children picking through the ruins of this garbage world looking for toys
- use it for 3d scanning
- infrared so it can see even in bad lighting conditions
- depth camera makes object isolation easy
- input into video synthesizers or computer generated art
- there is a kinect 2 with hd cams and usb3 and time-of-flight but its like 10x the price so dont bother

#####
##### really its just a weird camera

### my heart beats for nothing in this cruel twisted dystopia except *weird cameras*
